# Background

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

# Ask

**Business Questions:**

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

**Key Stakeholders:**

* Lily Moreno

* Cyclistic marketing analytics team

* Cyclistic executive team

# Prepare

The data include information about Cyclistic's historical trip and customers' patterns in bike usage. It is obtained between April 2022 and March 2023 (12 months).

# Process

R will be the primary tool for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.


## Data Preparation

**First, we need to import the tidyverse, lubridate, and ggplot2 packages to work with our data more efficiently.**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
```


**Set working directory:**
```{r}
setwd("/Users/hoangnguyen/Documents/Projects/Cyclistic_Project")
```


**Import the data from April 2022 to March 2023:**
```{r}
apr2022_trip <- read_csv('202204-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
may2022_trip <- read_csv('202205-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
jun2022_trip <- read_csv('202206-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
jul2022_trip <- read_csv('202207-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
aug2022_trip <- read_csv('202208-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
sep2022_trip <- read_csv('202209-divvy-publictripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
oct2022_trip <- read_csv('202210-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
nov2022_trip <- read_csv('202211-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
dec2022_trip <- read_csv('202212-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
jan2023_trip <- read_csv('202301-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
feb2023_trip <- read_csv('202302-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
mar2023_trip <- read_csv('202303-divvy-tripdata.csv',show_col_types = FALSE)
```

**Check column names before merging the data**
```{r}
colnames(apr2022_trip)
colnames(may2022_trip)
colnames(jun2022_trip)
colnames(jul2022_trip)
colnames(aug2022_trip)
colnames(sep2022_trip)
colnames(oct2022_trip)
colnames(nov2022_trip)
colnames(dec2022_trip)
colnames(jan2023_trip)
colnames(feb2023_trip)
colnames(mar2023_trip)
```

**Since all the data have the same column names, hence we can merge them together**
```{r}
trip_data = rbind(apr2022_trip, may2022_trip, jun2022_trip, jul2022_trip, aug2022_trip, sep2022_trip, oct2022_trip, nov2022_trip, dec2022_trip, jan2023_trip, feb2023_trip, mar2023_trip)
```

**Examine the data**
```{r}
head(trip_data)
str(trip_data)
nrow(trip_data)
```

## Data cleaning

**Let's create date, month, day, year, and day of week columns so that we can aggregate, analyze, and visualize our data later on.**

```{r}
trip_data$date <- as.Date(trip_data$started_at) 
trip_data$month <- format(as.Date(trip_data$date), "%m")
trip_data$day <- format(as.Date(trip_data$date), "%d")
trip_data$year <- format(as.Date(trip_data$date), "%Y")
trip_data$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(trip_data$date), "%A")
```

**Remove start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, and end_lng from the dataframe since we do not need it for analysis.**

```{r}
trip_data <- trip_data %>%
  select(-c(start_lat,start_lng,end_lat,end_lng))
```

**Count the total number of missing values**

```{r}
sum(is.na(trip_data))
```
*There are a total of 3471075 missing values.*


**Remove all the rows with missing values and assign to a new variable**
```{r}
trip_data_clean <- na.omit(trip_data)
```

*Before omitting all the rows with missing values, we have a total of 5803720 observations or rows. Now, we only have 4482362 rows.*


**Check for duplicated rows**
```{r}
nrow(trip_data_clean[duplicated(trip_data_clean), ])
```

*There are no duplicated rows*


**Create a ride length column in minutes and round to two decimal places**
```{r}
trip_data_clean$ride_length <- round(difftime(trip_data_clean$ended_at,trip_data_clean$started_at,units='mins'),2)
```

**Convert the data type of ride length to numeric for future analysis**
```{r}
trip_data_clean$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(trip_data_clean$ride_length))
```

**Count the number of negative ride length values**
```{r}
nrow(trip_data_clean[trip_data_clean$ride_length<0,])
```

**Order the day of week column**

```{r}
trip_data_clean$day_of_week <- ordered(trip_data_clean$day_of_week, 
                                    levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", 
                                             "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```


**Remove rows with negative and zero ride length values**
```{r}
trip_data_clean <- trip_data_clean[!(trip_data_clean$ride_length<0 | trip_data_clean$ride_length==0),]
```

*After removing rows with negative and zero values, we now have 4482044 rows.*

# Analyze

Analyzing the data will help us to discover insights and trends on how annual and casual riders use bike differently.

## Descriptive Analysis

**Summarize the data (calculate the mean, median, min, max, first quartile, and third quartile)**
```{r}
summary(trip_data_clean$ride_length)
```

## Data aggregation

**Compare annual and casual riders in terms of average, lower, upper, and difference in ride lengths**
```{r}
trip_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(lower_ride_length = min(ride_length), average_ride_length = mean(ride_length),
            upper_ride_length = max(ride_length), difference_ride_length = max(ride_length) - min(ride_length))
```
*Casual riders, on average, ride bikes roughly 11 more minutes than annual riders.*


**Count each member type (annual vs. casual)**
```{r}
trip_data_clean %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(total_count = n())
```

**Count number of each bike type**
```{r}
trip_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(rideable_type) %>% 
  summarise(total_count = n())
```

**Count the number for each type of bike for each user type**

```{r}
trip_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, rideable_type) %>% 
  summarise(total_count = n())
```


**Count number of rides by month and year**

```{r}
trip_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(month,year) %>% 
  summarise(total_count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(year)
```
**Count number of rides by weekday based on members type**

```{r}
trip_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(total_count = n()) 
```

**Average ride length by bike type**

```{r}
trip_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%

```

**Average ride length by members type and years**
```{r}
trip_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(member_casual,year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length))
```

# Share
Sharing the data will implement data visualizations to understand the data more effectively and gain insights visually.

## Data Visualizations

**Disable scientific notations**
```{r}
options(scipen=999)
```


**Create a new variable to calculate the percentage of annual and casual members for pie plot**
```{r}
member_perc <- trip_data_clean %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(perc=count/sum(count)) %>% 
  ungroup() 
```


**Create a pie chart that show the percentage distribution of member types**
```{r}
ggplot(member_perc, aes(x="", y=perc, fill=member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1,color="white") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +

  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity",color="black",width=0.7)+
  labs(title = 'Total Number of Rides by Member Types and Months',x='Month',y='Number of Rides')+
  theme_classic()
```

**Average ride duration spent by annual and casual members**
```{r}
trip_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(member_casual) %>%

  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity",color="black",width=0.5) +
  labs(title = 'Average Ride Duration Spent by Member Types',x='Type of Members',y='Average Ride Duration (mins)')+
  theme_classic()
```

**Average ride duration spent on each bike between annual and casual members**
```{r}
trip_data_clean %>% 
  group_by(member_casual,rideable_type) %>% 
  summarise(avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=rideable_type, y=avg_ride_length, fill=rideable_type))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity",color="black",width=0.5)+
  facet_wrap(~member_casual)+
  labs(title = 'Average Ride Duration Spent by Member and Bike Types', x='Type of Bikes', y='Average Ride Duration (mins)')+
